# Cloud-Health-Diagnostics
AI tool designed to support early-stage diagnosis by analysing medical scans (X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs). By using advanced machine learning models, the system first identifies the type of scan and then provides an initial diagnosis, helping both patients and doctors to get a clearer understanding of potential health issues before the specialist consultation. With its cloud-based infrastructure, the tool is easy to access from anywhere, making it a valuable resource for healthcare providers and improving the efficiency of the diagnostic process. The final accuracies of the models ranged from 67% to 83% based on the type of medical scan and the models used were CNNs, DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16 and VGG19.
